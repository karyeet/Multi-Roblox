# Multi-Roblox
Allows you to run multiple roblox instances, run before starting Roblox.
This is a stupid safe alternative to the WRD version, which does essentially the same thing.

To compile with VS 2019:
1. Install Visual Studio 2019
2. Open Developer Powershell from start
3. Run `cl /MC multiroblox.cpp`

To compile with GCC:
1. Install GCC
2. Open CMD or Powershell
2. Run `gcc multiroblox.cpp`


_**or use the executable provided in releases.**_
